# Disclaimer

**Fueled by espresso, late-night thoughts, and a suspiciously confident language model.**

Sure, AI hallucinates - but so do economists, world leaders, startup gurus, investors and most of LinkedIn.

This doc was prompted by humans, shaped with AI, and carefully combed through by a real-life human brain (yes, still caffeinated).

**A Friendly Reminder**

Nothing in this document should be taken as business, legal, or financial advice. Every startup is a different beast, with its own quirks, risks, and caffeine tolerance.

Treat these guides as idea starters — not gospel. Think of them like a playlist: hit play, see what resonates, skip what doesn’t.

We strongly encourage you to explore further, run your own tests, and dive headfirst into the University of YouTube (and beyond).

Build wisely, test often, and never outsource your critical thinking.

***Free Startup Credits**

We're stoked to offer access startup credits to help you on your journey. These credits are provided by third-party partners and platforms — we’re just the connector, not the provider.

We don’t control the terms, availability, or approval of any credits. So if you have questions, issues, or curious energy about your credit application, please reach out directly to the credit provider. They’ve got the answers, please don’t open support tickets or message us expecting someone on standby with a headset. We don’t have a call center. The AI assistant in the bottom right won’t help with this either (trust us, we asked).

**Let’s Collaborate**

If you're serious about building cool stuff and want to chat ideas, strategy, or your next big thing — book a call. That’s what we *are* here for.
